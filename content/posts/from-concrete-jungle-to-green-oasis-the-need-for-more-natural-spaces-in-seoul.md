In my previous blog post, I discussed the importance of green spaces in cities and why it is crucial for cities to prioritize their creation and maintenance. However, many cities around the world, including Seoul, are facing a shortage of green spaces, which has significant implications for the health and well-being of urban residents.

Seoul is the capital city of South Korea and home to over 10 million people. While the city has made significant progress in recent years towards becoming more sustainable, the lack of green spaces remains a major challenge. In this blog post, we will explore the shortage of green spaces in Seoul and its impact on the city's residents.

## Limited access to parks

One of the primary issues in Seoul is the limited access to parks. According to a study conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, there are only 11.5 square meters of green space per person, which is well below the recommended international standard of 15 square meters per person. This shortage of green space is particularly acute in densely populated neighborhoods, where there are few opportunities for residents to engage with nature.

To address this issue, the Seoul Metropolitan Government has launched a series of initiatives to create more parks and green spaces. However, progress has been slow due to the high cost of land in the city, as well as competing demands for development and infrastructure.

## Green spaces as urban oases

Despite the limited access to parks, there are still several examples of green spaces in Seoul that provide an oasis in the midst of the city's urban landscape. One such example is the Seoul Forest, a 1.2 million square meter park located in the heart of the city. The park is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, as well as walking trails, a botanical garden, and a pond.

Another example is the World Cup Park, which was created for the 2002 FIFA World Cup and spans over 200 hectares. The park includes a lake, forest, and several sports facilities, making it a popular destination for both locals and tourists.

However, while these parks provide a much-needed respite from the hustle and bustle of city life, they are still not sufficient to meet the needs of Seoul's growing population.

## Health implications

The shortage of green spaces in Seoul has significant implications for the health and well-being of its residents. Studies have shown that exposure to green spaces is associated with improved mental health, reduced stress levels, and increased physical activity.

Furthermore, the lack of green spaces in Seoul has led to increased air pollution levels, which can have serious health consequences. Air pollution is linked to respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and even premature death.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the shortage of green spaces in Seoul is a pressing issue that has significant implications for the health and well-being of the city's residents. While the Seoul Metropolitan Government has launched initiatives to create more parks and green spaces, progress has been slow due to the high cost of land and competing demands for development and infrastructure. To ensure that Seoul remains a livable and sustainable city, it is imperative that more efforts are made to create and maintain green spaces that are accessible to all residents.
